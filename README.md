## About dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

**Context**

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

**Content**

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

## Algorithm Used 

### Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well itâ€™s best suited for classification. The main objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in the feature space. The hyperplane tries that the margin between the closest points of different classes should be as maximum as possible. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is two, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is three, then the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds three.
